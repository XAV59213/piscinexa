[1.0.11] - 2025-05-09
Fixed

Fixed SyntaxError in sensor.py caused by invalid string in PiscinexaTempsFiltrationRecommandeSensor icon definition.

[1.0.10] - 2025-05-09
Changed

Added unit of measurement mg/L to sensors pH Actuel and pH Cible as per user request.

[1.0.9] - 2025-05-09
Fixed

Fixed translation error causing TypeError: expected str, got NoneType by removing unit_of_measurement: null from sensors without units in en.json and fr.json.

[1.0.8] - 2025-05-09
Fixed

Corrected missing or inconsistent units of measurement (h, m³, °C, mg/L, W, etc.) for all sensors by using native_unit_of_measurement and updating translations.

[1.0.7] - 2025-05-09
Added

Added new sensor "Temps de filtration effectué" to track the cumulative time (in hours) when the power sensor exceeds 10 W, indicating active filtration.

[1.0.6] - 2025-05-09
Changed

Renamed "Temps de filtration" sensor to "Temps de filtration recommandé" to better reflect its purpose.

[1.0.5] - 2025-05-08
Added

Added state change subscriptions to dynamically update sensors (PiscinexaTemperatureSensor, PiscinexaPhSensor, PiscinexaChloreSensor, PiscinexaPoolStateSensor, etc.) when dependent sensors or inputs change.

[1.0.4] - 2025-05-07
Added

Added PiscinexaPoolStateSensor to evaluate the overall pool state (temperature, chlorine, pH, filtration time) and indicate if swimming is allowed.

[1.0.3] - 2025-05-06
Added

Added issue_tracker field in manifest.json to direct users to GitHub issues.
Added hacs field in hacs.json to specify minimum HACS version.

Fixed

Updated sw_version to 1.0.2 in entity DeviceInfo for consistency with manifest.json.

[1.0.2] - 2025-05-05
Added

Added MIT License (LICENSE) to clarify usage terms.

[1.0.1] - 2025-05-04

Added CHANGELOG.md to document versions and changes.

[1.0.0] - 2025-04-01
Added

Initial release of the Piscinexa integration for Home Assistant.
Support for managing pool water quality (pH, chlorine, temperature, volume).
Features include:
Calculation of water volume based on pool dimensions.
Recommended filtration time based on temperature.
Calculation of pH and chlorine amounts to add.
Integrated log sensor (sensor.piscinexa_log).
Adjustable input numbers via the UI.
Custom services: piscinexa.test_calcul and piscinexa.reset_valeurs.
Buttons integrated into the interface.
Example dashboard YAML files (piscine_dashboard_custom_component.yaml and piscine_dashboard_multi.yaml).


Configuration flow to set up pool type, dimensions, and sensor or manual inputs for pH, chlorine, temperature, and power.
French translations (translations/fr.json) for configuration and entities.
Support for square and round pools.
Integration with HACS via hacs.json.
